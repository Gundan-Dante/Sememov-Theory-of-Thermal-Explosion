Hello! This is a simple code needed for investigation of combustion.

This code utilizes Semenov Theory of Thermal Explosion.

To learn more about the physics and thermodynamics part of the project, seek the pdf file.

There are 2 same codes that use different solvers (integrators): ODE45 and ODE15s.
